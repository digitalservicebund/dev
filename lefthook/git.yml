      # Installing @well-crafted/commitlint-config globally serves as a workaround for
      # achieving a zero config commitlint hook, for as long as
      # https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/issues/613 isn't fixed.
      #
      # Once this issue is addressed it'll allow for a truly zero config conventional
      # commits check, with just npx, like so:
      #
      # npx --yes --package="@commitlint/cli" --package="@well-crafted/commitlint-config" \
      #    commitlint --extends "@well-crafted/commitlint-config" --edit
      run: |
        [ ! -d "$(npm -g root)/@well-crafted/commitlint-config" ] && npm i -g @well-crafted/commitlint-config
        npx --yes commitlint --extends "@well-crafted/commitlint-config" --edit
